rebench [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gonum/graph.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jragonmiris/rebench)
=======

A simple package for re-benchmarking Go packages as you commit, and comparing the benchmarks with previous bests.

This is a command-line tool, not a package. After running `go get github.com/Jragonmiris/rebench` (or cloning and using `go install`), run `rebench -help` for usage information. All output is stores as either .txt or .json.
